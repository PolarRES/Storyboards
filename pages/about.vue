        <p>
          PolarRES is a Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Union, dedicated to advancing our understanding of Polar climates in a global context. The project explores key interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, assessing how these systems respond to and influence projected changes in global circulation. To address the uncertainties in climate change projections that hinder effective mitigation and adaptation efforts, PolarRES employs state-of-the-art regional climate models (RCMs) at unprecedented resolutions. PolarRES is a multi-partner project bringing together leading European experts across multiple climate science disciplines.

        <h2 class="text-center">The Storyboards</h2>
        <p>
          The PolarRES in Practice Stories translate key discoveries from the PolarRES project into accessible content for a broad audience. By breaking down complex scientific findings into clear summaries, explainers, and real-world applications, these stories highlight how PolarRES research can be used to address the challenges arising from changes in the Polar Regions. Acting as a bridge between cutting-edge science and practical knowledge, they support decision-making, sustainability efforts, and adaptation strategies, ensuring that our scientific insights have a real-world impact!
