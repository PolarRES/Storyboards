## PolarRES: more than computer coding
PolarRES is a project that is building a group of climate model simulations, known as an ensemble. This means we spend a lot of time developing and running computer code. However, we need to know that our models are capable of representing reality. In this story, we describe a fieldtrip to northern Greenland, where PolarRES partners DMI have been running a long-standing monitoring of a high Arctic fjord and the land surrounding it.

## A field laboratory for monitoring changes and testing models
The large fjord is known as Inglefield Bredning or Kangerlussuaq (there are several places with this name in Greenland). The region is used here as a field laboratory, allowing us to not only measure climate and other environmental changes as they happen, but also as a test site where we can compare our models with reality to make sure they work.

## Working together with the local Community

We work closely with the local community in this region. Our field station is managed by Aksel, who was brought up in the village of Qaanaaq. The main local source of employment is fishing, for halibut and hunting, for seal, reindeer, narwhal and walrus. DMI scientists travel out into the field with local hunters. Their knowledge of the snow and sea ice conditions, the weather and how to camp out overnight is unparalleled.

## Ocean and Sea ice Observations
The observations include standard weather stations as well as observations in the fjord of water temperature, salinity and biological activity. For the last 3 years, there has been a focus on the properties of the Arctic snow pack. DMI have been measuring the depth, temperature and density of the snow pack on land, on sea ice and on the glaciers in the region.

## Lots of data
Fourteen years of data on ocean, sea ice, and snow thickness, including snapshots and wintertime time series. Together with data from other sites in Greenland, we have gathered a large amount of information we can use to evaluate the output of our climate models.

## UAV Measurements

We have also been flying a UAV to measure surface temperatures over a wider area. Here you can see UAV measurements of surface temperature, the white spots are people, dogs and equipment. The black spot in the middle is the bright reflector we use as a control point.

## Do you want to dig a snow pit? 

The equipment you’ll need is shown here. This is snow on sea ice and it’s not very deep, only around 10 cm deep. But it is nevertheless important, because the snow acts as a very effective insulation layer, preventing the formation of sea ice (which grows from the top, because the sea below is much warmer. The air temperature is aboutt -19C in this photo, at the bottom of the snow on top of the ice it was only -5C. The sea ice is around a metre thick and the ocean water beneath it around +3C. 
Getting the snow depth right in our models is extremely importnat for all kinds of Arctic processes, including the growth of sea ice, local air temperatures, the permafrost and the survival of vegetation underneath the snow.

## Surface hoar crystals

These are surface hoar crystals, frost that forms in a very cold but still atmosphere on cold surfaces. Often we woke up to find them new grown overnight,  but in the sun, they evaporate again.

## Science in action 

1. A layer of large crystals between two layes of smaller ones. This is depth hoar, it’s an extremely important layer that forms when there is cold air above, and a warmer surface below. 
2. It is very very insulating
3. Our local hunters, pointing out polar bear footprints filmed by the UAV
4. DMI colleague taking a sea ice core to measure depth and salinity in the ice.

## Camp life 

We often camp out over 2 or 3 nights, we push the sleds together and put tents up over them to form a sheltered bed. There is a stove in each tent to allow equipment to dry out over night.

## Keeping the equipment warm 

We keep out scientific equipment inside the tent overnight to prevent the batteries getting too cold. The hunters help with the fieldwork and also with camp tasks like melting ice for drinking water and cooking with.
