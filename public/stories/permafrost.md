## What is permafrost?

- Permafrost is ground that stays frozen for at least two consecutive years, covering nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere.

- As Arctic temperatures rise rapidly, this frozen ground begins to thaw，causing the land to subside, damaging roads and buildings, and releasing ancient carbon stores in the form of greenhouse gases.

- The thaw of permafrost is both a local hazard and a global climate concern.

## Modeling the permafrost thaw

**The objective:** To quantify land surface subsidence and the potential risks of permafrost thawing in the Arctic region

## The Arctic is changing – fast

CNRM-driven runs are warmer than NORESM-driven ones, so they are coloured in warmer colours. The 2 m temperature increase is visible everywhere in the Arctic, and warming is more pronounced in the autumn and winter seasons.

## Rainfall

A more pronounced increase in rainfall is also related to the CNRM-driven runs, and patterns are very similar to T2. Spring, summer and autumn are expected to have the strongest rainfall increase.

## Rainfall

Interannual variability in snowfall patterns is high. Snowfall decline is faster in CNRM-driven runs. There are regional differences in snowfall patterns, and a strong decline is associated with coastal Norway, among others. Spring and summer are the seasons of the most pronounced snowfall decline throughout the period.

A change in the regional permafrost extent is very similar across configurations.

## The entire Arctic

- CNRM-driven simulations show a stronger decrease in permafrost extent 

- Our work accounts for two permafrost area extent definitions

Steinert et al. (2023) include a global permafrost change (also areas outside of the Arctic).

## Change in permafrost area (2015 – 2099)

Using one definition or the other yields very similar results.

## Future: areas of greatest ground subsidence

- The regions of projected largest ground subsidence lie between 60° and 70° N 

- 5 regions of the same spatial extent across the respective latitude belt are selected as they are projected to experience more than 1 m of ground subsidence until 2100

<!-- Section twelve -->

:::Chapter{headline="Future subsidence changes" image="img13.png"}

## Future subsidence changes

The period of the stronger subsidence depends on the region. A seemingly faster subsidence is from 2050-2060 onwards.

- The most pronounced change in subsidence (25 cm from present-day on average across the models) is in Canada (Region 5)

- The uncertainty in subsidence magnitude is the largest in Region 4 (Alaska-Bering Sea)

:::Chapter{headline="Outputs" image="img14.png"}

## Future subsidence changes

In most regions, permafrost outputs from GCMs are more similar to each other than those from RCMs. 

- CNRM-HCLIM-CTSM shows the fastest rate of permafrost thaw across the regions 

- The largest decrease in permafrost area extent is expected in Region 2 (around the Lena river) in Russia
